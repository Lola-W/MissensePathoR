\title{Predict Pathogenicity Scores for VCF Data}
\usage{
predictPathoScore(vcf_data, AlphaMissense_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf_data}{A data table containing variant call format (VCF) data.}

\item{AlphaMissense_data}{A data table containing Alpha Missense prediction data.}
}
\value{
A merged data.table where each variant is annotated with Alpha Missense
pathogenicity scores and classifications. Rows with variants not found in the
Alpha Missense data are excluded.
}
\description{
This function merges variant data from a VCF data.table with Alpha Missense
pathogenicity prediction data based on chromosome (CHROM), position (POS),
reference allele (REF), and alternate allele (ALT). It reports the number of
variants in the input VCF that could not be matched with a prediction and are
thus removed in the resulting data.table.
}
\details{
The merge operation is inner join-like, meaning only rows with matching keys in
both `vcf_data` and `AlphaMissense_data` will be included in the output. The keys
used for the merge are the genomic coordinates (CHROM, POS) and the alleles (REF, ALT).
The function will output a message to the console indicating the number of merged
rows and the number of rows from `vcf_data` that were not included in the merge due to
missing predictions.
